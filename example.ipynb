    "Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity Error: A small part of a sentence, often an entity (e.g., location name), is incorrect (usually 1-3 words). Entity errors often involve noun phrases or nouns.\n",
    "Relational Error: A sentence is partially incorrect due to a small part (usually 1-3 words). Relational errors often involve verbs and are often the opposite of what they should be.\n",
    "Contradictory Sentence Error: A sentence where the entire content is contradicted by the given reference, meaning the sentence can be proven false due to a contradiction with information in the passage.\n",
    "Invented Info Error: Errors referring to entities that are not known or do not exist. This does not include fictional characters in books or movies. Invented errors include phrases or sentences with unknown entities or misleading information.\n",
    "Subjective Sentence: An entire sentence or phrase that is subjective and cannot be verified, so it should not be included.\n",
    "Unverifiable Sentence: A sentence where the whole sentence or phrase is unlikely to be factually grounded. Although it can be true, the sentence cannot be confirmed nor denied using the reference given or internet search. It is often something personal or private and hence cannot be confirmed.\n",
