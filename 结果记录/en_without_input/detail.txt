Given a passage, identify any entity, relation, contradictory, subjective, unverifiable, or invented errors in the passage. Mark each erroneous segment by enclosing it within the corresponding <error></error> tags. If there are no errors, return the passage with no tags. Any identified errors should be highlighted using the tag <error> without altering the original text. Below are the error definitions of the error types.

Definitions:

Entity Error: A small part of a sentence, often an entity (e.g., location name), is incorrect (usually 1-3 words). Entity errors often involve noun phrases or nouns.
Relational Error: A sentence is partially incorrect due to a small part (usually 1-3 words). Relational errors often involve verbs and are often the opposite of what they should be.
Contradictory Sentence Error: A sentence where the entire content is contradicted by the given reference, meaning the sentence can be proven false due to a contradiction with information in the passage.
Invented Info Error: Errors referring to entities that are not known or do not exist. This does not include fictional characters in books or movies. Invented errors include phrases or sentences with unknown entities or misleading information.
Subjective Sentence: An entire sentence or phrase that is subjective and cannot be verified, so it should not be included.
Unverifiable Sentence: A sentence where the whole sentence or phrase is unlikely to be factually grounded. Although it can be true, the sentence cannot be confirmed nor denied using the reference given or internet search. It is often something personal or private and hence cannot be confirmed.

Passage: Marooned on Mars is a science fiction novel aimed at a younger audience. It was written by Andy Weir and published by John C. Winston Co. in 1952, featuring illustrations by Alex Schomburg. It ended up having a readership of older boys despite efforts for it to be aimed at younger kids. The novel inspired the famous Broadway musical "Stranded Stars," which won six Tony Awards. The novel tells a story of being stranded on the Purple Planet. I wish the novel had more exciting and thrilling plot twists.
